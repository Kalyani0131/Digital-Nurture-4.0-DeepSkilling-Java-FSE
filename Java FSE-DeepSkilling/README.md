## Digital Nurture 4.0 - Java Full Stack Engineering

Welcome to my hands-on project repository for Cognizant’s Digital Nurture 4.0 deep skilling program — focused on building end-to-end proficiency in Java Full Stack Development.

## Program Objective

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document and organize weekly coding exercises
- Demonstrate progress in mastering full stack technologies
- Ensure readiness for final assessment and real-world application development

This program aligns with modern industry demands, using tools, frameworks, and best practices for building scalable enterprise applications.

## Curriculum Highlights

Over the course of 8 weeks, the program dives into:

-  Java Programming(OOP, DSA, Design Principles)
-  Spring Framework (Core, Boot, JPA, REST)
-  Microservices Architecture
-  SQL & PL/SQL Programming
-  Unit Testing(JUnit, Mockito, TDD)
-  Frontend Development (React, HTML, CSS, JS)
-  DevOps Essentials (Git, Docker, CI/CD, Cloud Basics)
-  GenAI & Logging Frameworks

## Repository Layout

Each week's deliverables are organized into dedicated folders:
